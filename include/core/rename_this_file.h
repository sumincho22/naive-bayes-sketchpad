TODO: rename this file. You'll also need to modify CMakeLists.txt.

You can (and should) create more classes and files in include/core (header
 files) and src/core (source files); this project is too big to only have a
 single class.

Make sure to add any files that you create to CMakeLists.txt.

TODO Delete this comment before submitting your code.
